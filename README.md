## **Project Description**
DeHydra is a *passive-aggressive hydration webapp* where failing to drink water slowly kills a group of quirky pixel plants in a terrarium.  
Each plant has moods that degrade over time if you don’t log your water intake — complete with guilt-tripping messages and dramatic withering animations.  

---

## **The Problem (that doesn’t exist)**  
People ignore polite hydration reminders. The *real* issue? Lack of judgmental pixel plants silently watching you ruin their tiny green lives.  

---

## **The Solution (that nobody asked for)**  
We guilt-trip you into drinking water by tying the health of adorable yet emotionally manipulative digital plants to your hydration habits.  
Forget badges — here you get:  
- Withered leaves 
- A Dead Plant 

---

## **Technical Details**  

### **For Software:**  
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks:** None (Vanilla JS for guilt in its purest form)  
- **Libraries:** Google Fonts (DotGothic16), optional anime.js for smooth animations  
- **Tools:** VS Code, GitHub Pages / Netlify for deployment  

### **For Hardware:**  
- None (unless you count the emotional hardware of your conscience)
